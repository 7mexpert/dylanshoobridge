                lyrics: `You used to light up every room,
Now shadows linger in the gloom.
Your laughter's echo fades away,
A silent void where joy would stay.

I reach for you, but you're not there,
Just empty space and vacant air.
The warmth we had has turned to chill,
A love once vibrant, now so still.

Your eyes once sparkled, now they're dim,
A distant look, a fading hymn.
Conversations turn to sighs,
As silence grows between our ties.

I reach for you, but you're not there,
Just empty space and vacant air.
The warmth we had has turned to chill,
A love once vibrant, now so still.

I trace the steps we used to dance,
But find no rhythm, no romance.
The music stopped, the lights went low,
And left me standing in the throes.

I reach for you, but you're not there,
Just empty space and vacant air.
The warmth we had has turned to chill,
A love once vibrant, now so still.

The flicker fades, the flame is gone,
I'm left to face the breaking dawn.
In quiet rooms where love once burned,
I mourn the lessons never learned.`

                title: "The Unseen",
                album: "Single",
                lyrics: `I set the table, dim the lights,
Practiced words a hundred nights.
Footsteps echo down the hall,
Shadows dance along the wall.
The doorbell rings, my hands turn cold,
I wanted this—or so I'm told.
A shiver slithers through my spine,
They're here… but something isn't right.

Faces smiling, eyes so wide,
But I feel hollow deep inside.
Why do voices scratch my skin?
Why does terror creep within?
I asked them here, I called them near
Yet something else is waiting here…
The unseen… the unseen…

Laughter swirls, it drowns the air,
I see their shapes but no one's there.
Did I invite them? Was it me?
Or did they come to set me free?

The door stays shut, the windows weep,
My pulse is loud, my breath is weak.
They talk, they eat, they sip their tea,
Yet all their eyes are locked on me.

Faces smiling, eyes so wide,
But I feel hollow deep inside.
Why do voices scratch my skin?
Why does terror creep within?
I asked them here, I called them near
Yet something else is waiting here…
The unseen… the unseen…

The clock hands twitch, the walls collapse,
The candle flickers, whispers scratch.
I scream, I run, I claw the door
But I don't live here anymore.

They came for dinner… I fade away…
Now I'm the unseen… and they will stay.

Faces smiling, eyes so wide,
But I feel hollow deep inside.
Why do voices scratch my skin?
Why does terror creep within?
I asked them here, I called them near
Yet something else is waiting here…
The unseen… the unseen…`

Side by side but never crossing,
Something in the way you look at me feels new.
Late night echoes in my mind,
The things you say, the way you shine,
I wonder if you feel it too.

I don't wanna rush, don't wanna fall too fast,
But every moment's pulling me closer,
I don't know if you see it yet,
But i'm right here if you see it yet,

And maybe it's just me, maybe it's a sign,
The way your words stay tangled up in mine.
We're dancing on a line we've never walked before,
A little closer, just a little more.
Whispers Of A Heart

You pick me first, you stay behind,
Choosing me instead of time
And I can't help but wonder what it means.
We joke, we laugh, we stand so near
But every laugh it feels so clear
Like maybe there's more underneath.

If i say it out loud, will it change the way you see me?
Or are we already somewhere in between?

And maybe it's just me, maybe it's a sign,
The way your words stay tangled up in mine.
We're dancing on a line we've never walked before,
A little closer, just a little more.
Whispers Of A Heart

So I'll wait here in the space between,
Hoping that you're looking back at me.
Whispers Of A Heart

And maybe it's just me, maybe it's a sign,
The way your words stay tangled up in mine.
We're dancing on a line we've never walked before,
A little closer, just a little more.
Whispers Of A Heart

It's just a whisper of a heart
Maybe something more, i'm not sure
It's just a whisper of a heart
Maybe something more, i'm not sure`

Your footprints vanish at the gate.

I search the shore, but not for you.

The lighthouse doesn't turn tonight,
Its beam once warm, now void of light.
I call your name into the breeze,
But echoes drown beneath the seas.

The compass spins without a north,
A ship adrift, I venture forth.
Your silence, like a siren's song,
Leads me to where I don't belong.

The lighthouse doesn't turn tonight,
Its beam once warm, now void of light.
I call your name into the breeze,
But echoes drown beneath the seas.

In dreams, I sail to distant lands,
Clutching maps with trembling hands.
But every path and every chart,
Leads back to where we fell apart.

The lighthouse doesn't turn tonight,
Its beam once warm, now void of light.
I call your name into the breeze,
But echoes drown beneath the seas.

The stars above refuse to shine,
Reflecting this heartache of mine.
Adrift alone, I slowly learn,
The lighthouse doesn't turn.

The lighthouse doesn't turn tonight,
Its beam once warm, now void of light.
I call your name into the breeze,

Said your heart was mine to keep
But every promise you would make
Felt hollow when I'd try to sleep
Your words were sugar on my tongue
But poison underneath the truth
I held on tight, I stayed too long
Believing every line from you

I tried to read between the lines
But all I saw were painted skies
I built a home inside your words
Just to watch it burn alive

False lies, wrapped in pretty sounds
You held me up, then let me down
I trusted you with open eyes
Still fell for all your false lies
Cold truths hiding in disguise
You said forever, meant goodbye
Now I'm the one who's learned to rise
From the wreckage of your false lies

You played the part, you wore the smile
Like honesty was just a game
Every "soon" took quite a while
Every tear spelled out your name
I traced the cracks along your voice
Heard the doubt you tried to hide
But I ignored my better choice
'Cause love can make you colorblind

I tried to hold what wasn't real
I tried to fix what you wouldn't feel
I gave you truth, you gave me signs
That nothing here was ever mine

False lies, wrapped in pretty sounds
You held me up, then let me down
I trusted you with open eyes
Still fell for all your false lies
Cold truths hiding in disguise
You said forever, meant goodbye
Now I'm the one who's learned to rise
From the wreckage of your false lies

Maybe I was chasing smoke
Maybe you were mirrors and ghosts
But every cut you left behind
Taught me how to draw the line

No more echoes in my head
No more tears for words you said
I'm done believing half-alibis
I'm done living your false lies

False lies, I see them clear now
Every promise breaking down
You don't own my heart or time
I'm free from all your false lies
Real strength comes from goodbye
I found my truth on the other side
I won't fall, I won't apologize
For walking out on your false lies
You can keep your pretty disguise
I'm done surviving false lies`

You pretend I'm not even there.
You talk in constellations,
Counting signs that don't include my name.
You say I'm hard to figure,
But baby, you're the one to blame.

You act like love's a horoscope,
But I can see right through the smoke.

You give me half your heart, then say it's enough,
Like I'm the thirteenth sign you never trust.
I'm right here burning in your sky for you 
Don't treat me like I'm Ophiuchus.

You chase the fire of Sagittarius,
Then drown in Pisces tears.
But when it comes to something serious,
You disappear for years.
I'm tired of being your mystery,
The one you never want to claim.
You say the stars decide our history,
But baby, you wrote this pain.

I'm not the shadow of your chart,
I'm the one who loved you from the start.

You give me half your heart, then say it's enough,
Like I'm the thirteenth sign you never trust.
I'm right here burning in your sky for you 
Don't treat me like I'm Ophiuchus.

Maybe I was born between the lines,
Never meant to fit your grand design.
But if the stars forgot my name,
It doesn't mean I'll fade away.

You give me half your heart, then say it's enough,
Like I'm the thirteenth sign you never trust.
I'm right here shining, I'm proof of truth 
Don't treat me like I'm Ophiuchus.

I'm not the one you overlook,
Don't treat me like I'm Ophiuchus.`

I saw your hand in his today.
Every word you said replays,
Like a ghost that won't fade away.
We were thunder before the rain,
Now I'm drowning in the pain,
You said love would never break
Guess promises still can.

I gave you every part of me,
But love doesn't beg, it sets you free.
I stood there watching you let go,
Trying to smile, pretending to know
That maybe someday it'd make sense,
But it still hurts like it did back then.

You chose him, and I can't change it,
No rewind, no explanation.
All those dreams we painted bright,
You tore 'em down with one goodbye.
I hope he loves you like I did,
Even if it breaks me within
You chose him.

I still drive by your street,
Like the past's got GPS,
I replay what you told me,
When you said you "needed rest."
Funny how rest means someone else,
While I can't get any sleep,
I hope you find your heaven,
Even if it's not with me.

Guess love's a risk, a coin that flips,
And I just lost my final wish.
You found your light, I lost my flame,
Two hearts, but never the same.
I still whisper your name in vain,
But echoes fade, and so does pain.

You chose him, and I can't change it,
No rewind, no explanation.
All those dreams we painted bright,
You tore 'em down with one goodbye.
I hope he loves you like I did,
Even if it breaks me within
You chose him.

Maybe one day you'll remember,
The way I said your name,
But I'll be gone like summer,
And you'll still call his name.

You chose him, and I won't chase it,
My heart's bruised, but I'll still face it.
All that's left is truth and pain,
You moved on, I'll do the same.
I hope he holds you like I did,
Even if it burns again
You chose him.
Yeah... you chose him.
And I let you.`

But my stomach hit the pavement,
When I saw that look in your eyes.
You said, "Do you think I could get with her?"
Like it wasn't twisting the knife,
You don't even know, she's been
Running laps inside my mind.

I tried to laugh, play it cool,
Pretend I don't care what you do,
But now I can't sleep, can't breathe 
Just need the damn truth.

Is it true?
Did you say it just to mess with my head?
Is it true?
Are you talking to her when I'm gone to bed?
'Cause I swear if you're lying,
I don't know what I'll do 
But I can't stop asking,
Is it true?

Now her name hits different when I hear it,
In the hallway, in your texts,
And I keep checking her story,
Like I'm waiting for the wreck.
You said maybe she's into you now,
And laughed like it's some game,
But I'm losing my mind here,
And you don't feel the same.

I tried to chill, keep my cool,
But I'm burning through the rules,
Man, this just ain't fair 
What the hell am I supposed to do?

Is it true?
Did you say it to mess with my head?
Is it true?
Are you talking to her when I'm gone to bed?
'Cause I swear if you're lying,
I don't know what I'll do 
But I can't stop asking,
Is it true?

I know she's not mine, never was,
But damn, it still feels like a loss.
And you, you should've known,
That she's the one I talk about when we're alone.

Is it true?
Did you really go and cross that line?
Is it true?
Or am I just losing my mind?
If you got her, then own it —
Don't make me look like a fool.
Just say it straight,
Yeah, tell me,
Is it true?
Is it true...

But your ghost still haunts my days
Every street and every song
Feels like where we both went wrong

You left a crack in my heart
But I still see you in the dark
Tried to move on, but I can't lie
I'd still run to you every time
Even when the sky turns blue
I'm still lost without you

Your hoodie's still on my chair
Like you're somehow still halfway there
Friends say time will do its part
But time don't know my heart

They say love comes, then it fades
But ours just bent, it never breaks
And I still hear your voice
In every quiet choice I make

You left a crack in my heart
But I still see you in the dark
Tried to move on, but I can't lie
I'd still run to you every time
Even when the sky turns blue
I'm still lost without you

I almost let you slip away
Almost let the hurt outweigh
But then your hand found mine again
And I swore I'd never let it end

You left a crack in my heart
But love still found its way through the dark
Tried to move on, but we both knew
My soul was always tied to you
Now even storms can't pull us through
'Cause I found my way
Back to you`

Where the laughter lived, now the silence sits instead
We were building futures in the palms of our hands
Now I walk those dreams alone, trying to understand

How did closeness turn to distance overnight?
How did holding on start feeling like a fight?

I love you, but I can't stay
When every word we speak is slipping further away
We were oceans once, overflowing in the dark
Now look at us... completely washed apart
I love you but loving you is tearing me in two
So I'll go, even though every part of me
Still runs back to you

We were almost perfect, almost finally right
But the "almost" always turned into another night
Where we talked in circles, never really heard
Holding back the truth, swallowing every Single word

How did comfort turn to walking on a wire?
How did all that warmth turn into quiet fire?

I love you, but I can't stay
When every word we speak is slipping further away
We were oceans once, overflowing in the dark
Now look at us... completely washed apart
I love you but loving you is tearing me in two
So I'll go, even though every part of me
Still runs back to you

I never wanted distance
I never wanted goodbye
But I can't be the only heart
Still willing to try
Tell me...
Do you remember how it felt
When we were us?
'Cause I do... every day

Wish I could hold you
Without breaking
Wish we could fix us
Without faking
But love shouldn't feel
Like losing myself
I love you, but I can't stay
Baby, keeping us alive shouldn't cost me everything
We were oceans once, overflowing in the dark
Now look at us... completely washed apart
I love you but loving you is tearing me in two
So I'll go...
But God, I hope one day you'll know
I never stopped loving you

We were side-by-side
Now we're worlds apart
But a piece of me
Still lives where you are`

From whispers in the smoke
To headlines in our small-town minds

In someone else's version of my life
You're my plus one, I'm your alibi
And I can't tell if I should laugh or cry

Now when I walk in, I can feel the eyes
Like we had a past that I've been trying to hide

Maybe I'd play the part the way they want me to

It's wild how words can bend
And still sound like the truth
I almost started doubting me

You're my plus one, I'm your alibi

Got my name in stories I've never told
They can dance in the dark with what they've done
But I'm not the one, no, I'm not the one

I never kissed you, never touched your hand
But somehow I'm your biggest fan
And in their world, I'm someone else's crime
You're my plus one, I'm your made-up line

You can't build dreams on alibis.

Maybe truth got lost in your crooked smile.

With nothing tied around my chest
No promises I can't defend
No fear of being second best
I'm not lonely, I'm just honest
With the way my heart runs
I'm learning how to love my life
In this bubble made for one

I watched my friends build homes in pairs
Fold their names into shared prayers
I tried to picture myself there
But I never fully appeared
I love too deep, I drift too far
I need whole nights to fall apart
And every time I almost stay
My soul keeps asking me to walk away

Maybe love was never late
Maybe it just wasn't meant to look that way

Without turning cold or numb
I don't need a hand to hold
To know where I'm from
I'm not lonely, I'm just listening
To who I've become
I'm learning how to love my life
In this bubble made for one

If love comes knocking, I won't lie
I'll open up, I just won't hide
Behind the fear of being one
Or trade my peace for almost love
I won't shrink to be adored
I won't bleed to be wanted more

I'm learning how to trust myself
Without needing someone else
No waiting rooms inside my head
No half-lived wishes on a shelf
I'm not lonely, I'm just choosing
What my heart's always done
I'm learning how to love my life
In this bubble made for one

Like a story that's grown too old.
I'm right here, screaming silently,
But it's easier pretending you don't see.
I'm invisible…

Maybe one day, I'll make a sound
Loud enough to shake the ground.
And maybe then, just maybe then,
You'll turn around…

Like a voice that's lost its key.
Still hoping someone might believe,
There's more to me than what they see.

And nothing ever feels the same

You built a world I wasn't in
But I still trace it on my skin

But every joke still feels half-lit

You were the echo in my song
But echoes fade when time moves on

I'll never find a love like ours

Or how we danced through all that pain

I don't regret, I don't hold tight
I dream of you some quiet nights
And even now, I say your name
